# Super-BPD for Fast Image Segmentation (cv2PR 2020)

## Introduction

We propose direction-based super-BPD, an alternative to superpixel, for fast generic image segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art real-time result.

## Prerequisite
* pytorch >= 1.3.0
* g++ 7

## Dataset
* Download the [BSDS500  & PascalContext Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OdfkelacNMmcp3STVyGzPql-Z21Efxqk/view?usp=sharing), and unzip it into the `Super-BPD/` folder.

## Testing
* Compile cuda code for post-process.

```
cd post_process
python setup.py install
```

* Download the pre-trained [PascalContext model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-bkw7CURrmVwjpMvVb_QbSlIwhj-glS/view?usp=sharing) and put it in the `saved` folder.

* Test the model and results will be saved in the `test_pred_flux/PascalContext` folder.

* [SEISM](https://github.com/jponttuset/seism) is used for evaluation of image segmentation.

## Training
* Download [VGG-16 pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13G5HaMQcZ-GsXL2nEaoC_2s3Sewmuag-/view?usp=sharing).

```
python train.py --dataset PascalContext
```
